## Summary

Node-Web-Console is a web-based Node.js application that allows to execute shell commands on a server directly from a browser (web-based SSH). This project is inspired by the php-based [web-console](https://github.com/nickola/web-console). 
The application is very light, does not require any database and can be installed and configured in about 3 minutes.

## Features

- Clean interface, which looks and feels like a real shell terminal
- Easy to extend. Node-Web-Console uses [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) to start the web server. You can easily extend it or integrate it to your own project
- Secure. You can configure HTTPS (SSL) on your web server and all Node-Web-Console traffic will be protected. Also, Node-Web-Console has a mark to search engines that will disallow the Node-Web-Console page from indexing
- Fast configuration. Node-Web-Console is a pure Node.js project and can be installed and configured quickly
- Mobile friendly. Node-Web-Console supports inputs from the virtual keyboard in the mobile browser. So you can use it conveniently in your mobile devices like iPad, iPhone and Android phones.


## Installation

Node-Web-Console uses [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) to start the web server, so it requires node v7.6.0 or higher.
